# Interaction redundancy
**Interaction redundancy**, i.e., the functional redundancy in microbial interactions, was proposed to describe the conserved functional roles of microbial interactions within a community. We provided AURORA (quAntify the fUnctional Redundancy in micrObial inteRactions using pArtial information decomposition) package here to quantify the interaction redundancy within a microbial community from microbial abundance data.
